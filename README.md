# Parking

This GitLab will be used as a place for our group to store all relevant documents to our project.

## Inspiration
The idea of our project was based on the presentation [Parking on campus](https://medium.com/@kjs026/parking-on-campus-a-frustrating-time-consuming-issue-259ae8160b6#.cl5gaysto) that we saw in class.
